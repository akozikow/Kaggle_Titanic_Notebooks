# Kaggle_Titanic_Notebooks
A few Jupyter Notebooks developed for Kaggle's famous introductory Data Science competition to predict Titanic passenger survival.

In this repository I have put two notebooks; one uses standard ML classifiers (e.g, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost), and the other leverages Pytorch to create a Neural Network Classifier.
